BATTLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOODS - COLIN BURGESS
AS REQUIRED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE IBM PROFESSIONAL DATA SCIENCE CERTIFICATE

https://github.com/colinB890/final_neighbourhoods - Project link.

In this project I mostly used some of the concepts introduced in this program, using two different, using the city of Edmonton AB as the model.

One file pertains to Edmonton City Police Crime stats, and another pertains to the neighbourhoods. The second file contains the Longitudinal and Latitudinal values needed for foursquare. 

Very generic information is provided, however one might use this information when decdiding where to purchase a house, or for a builder considering where to build on real estate. Determining factors in buying a house would include, but not be limited to:

1. Crime. (Safety first)

2. Development of neighbourhood. I know when I moved into my current neighbourhood at first, one thing which kept the property value low was the total lack of ammenities, such as shopping and gas stations. However, once these ammenities were added, property value soared.

I hope a model like this could potentially be used for a realtor, or anyone considering where to look around in, in this city of Edmonton.

There are ideas which I did not include in this project, for reasons of my own inadequacy, and hope to develop an eventual program which would provide a heat map of my area, allowing a user to drag a cursor over the area showing them the statistics which they could explore further. For now my limited skills will reflect in this project, unfortunately. 

My source files are from the city of Edmonton Police website and the city of Edmonton data site, which now has open access to much data.
